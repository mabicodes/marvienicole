### About me:
Hello, I'm Nicole and I'm in the process of becoming a Fullstack Web Developer. *#FemTechBCN* 
I'm currently enjoying the frustration of "not knowing" and the satisfaction of finally understanding. ðŸ˜„

  <summary>More about me...</summary>
  <p>When I was in 5th grade, I learned a great lesson from my maths teacher and applied it to my everyday life up until now.
 He gave us a paper with a bunch of excercises and I noticed these paragraphs with a huge blank space for us fill with words
 "Problem", "Solution" and "Answer". </p>
 <p>And yeah, ever since that day, I applied this method "find the problem", "search for solutions", 
 "share the best and simplified answer" 
 and now here I am! Learning how to code! ðŸ˜³ </p>
